<h2><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> Important bug fixes and announcement</h2>
<p>Hello! I don't like to bother users with a message when the extension is updated, but in this version I have fixed issues that prevented a lot of users from using some features, and I have an announcement to make so I'll start with it.</p>
<h4>What's planned for 2020</h4>
<p>This will depend entirely on you. Now that issues have been fixed I would like to add the most requested features (block 60FPS videos, reverse playlist order, capture image from video, choose toolbar location) but I have a lot of other things to do and my free time is limited so I must review my priorities and make choices.</p>
<p>Until now, maintaining this extension has been my top priority because you are more than 1.1 million to use it (all browsers combined), but in 2019 so far I have only received 92 donations from 86 donors, which represents only 0,0078181% of total users.</p>
<p>I distribute this extension for free since years so it would be really rewarding to receive recognition from time to time for the countless hours I have spent updating and improving it for you (I personaly don't need all the features). It's the giving season so if you are one of the 99.99219% of users who haven't made a donation yet please consider doing so.</p>

<p>By donating or not donating you will all let me know if it is worth it to spend more time adding new features, or if I should dedicate my free time to my other projects instead of leaving them out like I do since too much time for this extension. In the latter case I will simply do the bare minimum to keep the extension up-to-date with upcoming changes on YouTube, nothing more.</p>
<h4>What's new in this release</h4>
<p>(As a last gift?!? It's up to you!) I have made some minor code improvements and I have added the two most requested features:</p>
<ol>
  <li>You will never get annoyed again by the “Video paused. Continue watching?” prompt that appears after approximately 35-40 minutes of inactivity when a long video or a playlist is playing in a background tab.</li>
  <li>The extension will prevent the page from jumping to the top when you will click timestamp links in comments if the player is pinned.</li>
</ol>

<h4>What has been fixed</h4>
<p>Note: I cannot fix odd issues that have been reported without clear instructions to reproduce them.
<ul>
  <li><strong>Mac and Linux:</strong> The player's menu appears when the right mouse button is pressed to control the volume level.</li>
  <li><strong>Multi-touch trackpad:</strong> The pinch in (zoom out) and pinch out (zoom in) gestures over the video modify the playback speed instead of zooming in/out.</li>
  <li>Video aspect ratios different than 16:9 (i.e. 4:3, 18:9, 21:9, and others) not supported by the large player mode.</li>
  <li>Player, progress bar, and other elements not correctly resized when the window is minimised/maximised while the large player mode is active.</li>
  <li>Tollbar not visible when it should.</li>
  <li>Toolbar visible when YouTube's mini player is enabled.</li>
  <li>Cinema mode still active and preventing page scrolling when YouTube's mini player is enabled.</li>
  <li>Playback speed buttons “-” and “+” reversed when the “Reverse the mouse wheel direction...” feature is enabled.</li>
  <li>Dark themes issues.</li>
  <li>Dark theme still partially visible and causing issues when disabled while no YouTube tab was open.</li>
  <li><strong>Old YouTube layout:</strong> The player's menu appears when the right mouse button is pressed while the cursor is over the video's black borders (not the black borders visible when YouTube's Theater mode is active).</li>
</ul>

<h4>How to remove the keyboard shortcuts button</h4>
<p>This has been already explained in a comment months ago but I keep getting asked about this so I have now updated the code and placed it at the bottom of the <a href="https://www.mrfdev.com/youtube-keyboard-shortcuts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">keyboard shortcuts list</a>, just above the comments, for those of you who never read them...</p>
<h4>That's it!</h4>
<p>♫♪♫ [Christmas music] ♫♪♫ I wish you all a Merry Christmas and a happy holiday season with the people who matter to you. All the best!<br><br>-----<br>The Developer</p>
